								<p>Hi! I'm an undergraduate at UC Santa Barbara, pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science. Originally from the East Bay Area, I currently reside in the South San Jose area. I created this website to showcase and give more insight into my work. I have an interest in the data analytics and tech industry, with experience using R, SQL, C++, and HTML.</p>

								<p>With over 7 years experience of tutoring elementary, middle, high school, and college students, both in-person and online, I'm also working towards a minor in education with a focus on the secondary track of science and mathematics. I currently serve as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, in which I hold biweekly office hours, lead lab sections, and facilitate lectures to answer student questions. As I strive to facilitate my students’ learning, my greatest priority as a tutor is to build rapport: I believe that a student is best able to learn in an environment where they feel comfortable enough to ask questions and make mistakes. My consistent efforts in building this rapport have successfully aided me in transforming the tutor-tutee relationship into friendships, ultimately encouraging students to attend office hours more regularly and become more proactive with their education.</p>
									
								<p>Aside from academia, I'm extremely passionate about advocating, discussing, and caring for mental health. I've had the opportunity to involve myself with Lean On Me, an anonymous peer-to-peer texting service specializing in providing emotional support for college students across different campuses. As a supporter of the UCSB chapter, I've practiced effective communication skills such as attentive listening, awareness, and reflection to best provide emotional support for my peers. As a dedicated supporter, I am also committed to my position on the executive board, having served as the Finance Coordinator in the 2022-23 academic year and the current Social Media Coordinator. Other responsibilities I execute on the board include leading biweekly club meetings, interviewing and training incoming supporters, and having presented at UCSB’s 2023 Mental Health Conference.</p>
								
								<p>It would be a privilege to bridge my interests and skills in the field of data science with my passion for making an impact on my community. 
									I am invested in finding solutions and playing a role in creating a better world.

								<p>Through my involvement with Lean On Me, I had the opportunity to work in the data analytics team as a Data Visualization Intern for the national team in the summer of 2022. 
									By analyzing over 6 years of existing temporal, binary, qualitative and quantitative data, 
									I created visualizations using the ggplot2 and Plotly libraries under R, in order to display on the organization’s national as well as individual chapter websites. 
									With this data, I drew conclusions and relationships through visualizing bar graphs, time series charts, and box-and-whisker plots to effectively communicate the texting services’ impact in its communities.</p>

									<p> Below are selected visualizations I created for the National website:</p>

								<p>A math major at heart, I came into my post-secondary education intending to pursue mathematics for my completion of AP Calculus BC, having not even taken any statistics course. 
									I knew I was interested in math as I never complained devoting any extra time in digesting its dense material. As I got deeper into the math major, I had been told that pure math was extremely different from number math, 
									and my expectations were met. As confusing as the Gram-Schmidt procedure or Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem could get, I still found passion in logically finding my way through a proof. 
									However, I still missed that tangible solution that number math offered me, which invoked me to pursue statistics. With a passion for mathematics, I’ve intensely covered subjects as linear algebra, topology, and real analysis, diving deep into their theoretical nature. 
									I’ve been fortunate enough that these courses have led me to develop a better understanding and visualization of the data transformation and model evaluation to supplement my pursuit in data science, as I’ve taken courses on applied probability and statistical theory, 
									linear regression, and soon machine learning in the winter. As much as I love math, I love how the logic of math can be applied in computer science and programming. 
									Data science offers me the best of both worlds and I’ve had an amazing experience aligning these two fields. </p>
