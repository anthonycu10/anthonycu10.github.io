		<p>Hi and welcome to my portfolio! I'm a 3rd year undergraduate at UC Santa Barbara, double majoring in Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science. 
			Aside from my professional interest in the data science industry, with an emphasis on data analytics, 
			I am passionate about helping others and making a difference in my community, which motivates me in other pursuits such as education and mental health awareness.
		</p>
		<p>It would be a privilege to bridge my interests and skills in the data analytics field, especially in storytelling and working with big data, with my passion for making an impact on others. 
			I am invested in finding solutions and playing a role in paving a better future.
		</p>

		<h4>About Me</h4>
		<p>Originally from the East Bay Area, I currently reside in the Silicon Valley.
		In my free time, I enjoy catching up with friends and family by grabbing coffee or boba. I love trying new coffee shops and am always on the lookout for new places for productivity.
		I love going on walks, creative writing & poetry, and listening to Taylor Swift. One of my favorite songs of all time would have to be "Clean (Taylor's Version)" from 1989 (Taylor's Version), of course.
		Some facts about me: I enjoy spontaneity and appreciate the use of uncommon jargon.
		</p>

		<!--	<p>With experience in data visualization using ggplot2 and big data with data manipulation tools such as SQL and dplyr to extract, clean, condense, and merge data, I am seeking a data analysis internship to utilize my skills for the success of the organization.-->	

		</p>
		
		<h4>Education</h4>
		<p>With over 7 years experience of tutoring elementary, middle, high school, and college students, both in-person and online, I'm complementing my double major with a minor in education with a focus on the secondary track of science and mathematics. 
		<br><br>I currently work as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) for the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, in which I hold biweekly office hours, lead lab sections, and facilitate lectures alongside faculty to answer student questions. 
		As a ULA for <em><u>PSTAT 10</u>: Principles of Data Science with R</em> for over 4 quarters now, I’ve had the opportunity to add my own insights into the course based on what I’ve noticed students tend to need the most support. 
		I’ve been able to shape and curate course content by constructing quizzes and leading review sessions. 
		<br><br>In addition, I am a statistics tutor for Campus Learning Assistance Services, UCSB’s campus tutoring service. I lead drop-in hours to assist students in concepts such as distributions, random variables, Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorems, and hypothesis testing.
		<br><br>As I strive to facilitate my students’ learning, my greatest priority as an instructor is to build rapport: I believe that a student is best able to learn in an environment where they feel comfortable enough to ask questions and make mistakes. 
		My consistent efforts in building this rapport have successfully aided me in transforming the tutor-tutee relationship into friendships, ultimately encouraging students to attend drop-in hours more regularly and become more proactive with their education.</p>
		
		<h4>Mental Health</h4>
		<span>Aside from academia, I'm extremely passionate about advocating, discussing, and caring for mental health. 
			I've had the opportunity to involve myself with Lean On Me, an anonymous peer-to-peer texting service specializing in emotional support for college students across different campuses. 
			<br><br>As a supporter and executive board member for the UCSB chapter, I've practiced effective communication skills such as attentive listening, awareness, and reflection to best support service users. 
			Some accomplishments I’ve achieved on the board include:</span>
		<ul>
			<li>as the Finance Coordinator (2022-23): networked and presented to relevant organizations, successfully raising $2000+ of funding; maintained annual budget plan, managing national fees and chapter-specific payments</li>
			<li>as the Social Media Coordinator (2023-24): designed infographics announcing chapter logistics, advertising social events, and spreading awareness on various mental health topics</li>
			<li>presented at UCSB’s 2023 Mental Health Conference, discussing self-care and academic burnout </li>
			<li>led biweekly supporter meetings, interviewed and trained incoming supporters</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Diseases Of Affluence (Summer - Fall 2023)</h3> 
		<p>I've most recently had the opportunity to take part in a research study examining how non-communicable diseases (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, or obesity) are associated with overnutrition and unhealthy eating habits, i.e. the Diseases of Affluence, particularly working with datasets in India. 
			Working alongside Dr. Gurmeet Manku, Ph.D.; Dr. Uma Ravat, UCSB; and my collaborator Jake Bentley, we created survey data visualizations, fitted linear models, and performed nonparametric tests to isolate wealth and dietary factors having positive correlations with obesity and NCDs.

		<h3>Lean On Me (Summer 2022)</h3> 
		<p>Through my involvement with Lean On Me UCSB, I had the opportunity to join the data analytics team of Lean On Me National as a Data Visualization Intern in summer 2022. 
			By analyzing over 6 years of existing temporal, binary, qualitative, and quantitative data, I created 100+ visualizations in R (particularly with ggplot2, Plotly) to display on the national and individual chapter websites. 
			With this data, I drew bar graphs, time series charts, and box-and-whisker plots to effectively communicate the organization's impact. 
			These visualizations have been used to supplement the organization in its marketing/funding pursuits and offered insight into how to update supporter training protocols based on user activity trends. <br>

<!--			<p>Before entering college, I was precautioned that studying pure math would be vastly different from the number math I was used to in high school;
					 nonetheless, those expectations were met. As confusing as the Gram-Schmidt procedure or Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem could get, 
					 I still found passion in logically finding my way through a proof. 
					 I’ve intensely covered subjects such as linear algebra, topology, and real analysis, 
					 diving deep into their purely theoretical nature. 
					 However, I still missed that tangible solution that number math offered me, which invoked me to pursue statistics. 
				</p> 
				<p>The first statistics course I ever took, PSTAT 10, became the first course I was a learning assistant for, in my second year of college. 
					 Even though I felt lacking in my statistics ability, being a learning assistant boosted my confidence and allowed me 
					 the thought that I was just as capable. As I journeyed further in studying statistics and data science, 
					 I took on courses such as applied probability and statistical theory, linear regression, and machine learning. 
					 I’ve been fortunate enough that my math courses have led me to develop a better understanding and visualization of data transformation and model evaluation 
					 to supplement my pursuit of data analytics and science.
