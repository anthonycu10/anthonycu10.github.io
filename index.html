		<h2 class="major">About</h2>
		<span class="image"><img src="images/intropic.png"  width = "300" class = "center" alt="" /></span>						
		<p>Hi! I'm an undergraduate at UC Santa Barbara, pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science. Originally from the East Bay Area, I currently reside in the South San Jose area. I created this website to showcase and give more insight into my work. I have an interest in the data analytics field and tech industry, with proficiency in R, SQL, C++, and HTML.</p>
		<p>With over 7 years experience of tutoring elementary, middle, high school, and college students, both in-person and online, I'm also working towards a minor in education with a focus on the secondary track of science and mathematics. I currently serve as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, in which I hold biweekly office hours, lead lab sections, and facilitate lectures to answer student questions. As I strive to facilitate my students’ learning, my greatest priority as a tutor is to build rapport: I believe that a student is best able to learn in an environment where they feel comfortable enough to ask questions and make mistakes. My consistent efforts in building this rapport have successfully aided me in transforming the tutor-tutee relationship into friendships, ultimately encouraging students to attend office hours more regularly and become more proactive with their education.</p>
		<span>Aside from academia, I'm extremely passionate about advocating, discussing, and caring for mental health. I've had the opportunity to involve myself with Lean On Me, an anonymous peer-to-peer texting service specialized in providing emotional support for college students across different campuses. As a supporter and executive board member for the UCSB chapter, I've practiced effective communication skills such as attentive listening, awareness, and reflection to best provide emotional support for my peers. Some accomplishments I’ve achieved on the board include:</span>
		<ul>
		<li>as the Finance Coordinator (2022-23): networked and presented to relevant organizations, successfully raising over $2000 of funding; maintained annual budget plan, managing national fees and chapter-specific payments</li>
		<li>as the Social Media Coordinator (2023-24): created advertisement and information designs, that discuss and spread awareness on mental health related topics </li>
		<li>presented at UCSB’s 2023 Mental Health Conference </li>
		<li>lead biweekly club meetings, interview and train incoming supporters</li>
		</ul>
		<p>It would be a privilege to bridge my interests and skills in the field of data science with my passion for making an impact on the community. I am invested in finding solutions and playing a role in creating a better world.</p>

		<p>Through my involvement with Lean On Me, I had the opportunity to work in the data analytics team as a Data Visualization Intern for the national team in the summer of 2022. 
		By analyzing over 6 years of existing temporal, binary, qualitative and quantitative data, 
		I created visualizations using the ggplot2 and Plotly libraries under R, in order to display on the organization’s national as well as individual chapter websites. 
		With this data, I drew conclusions and relationships through visualizing bar graphs, time series charts, and box-and-whisker plots to effectively communicate the texting services’ impact in its communities.</p>
	
		<p> Below are selected visualizations I created for the National website:</p>

		<p>I, like many other students, struggled with choosing a major when applying to colleges. I came into my post-secondary education pursuing mathematics for my completion of AP Calculus BC, having not even taken any statistics course yet. It wasn't that I loved math, but it was the one subject I tolerated the most in grade school. I never complained about devoting extra time to digesting formulas and learning dense procedures. My family and friends expected me to pursue computer science, as I had a fair amount of experience and knowledge. I love programming, as algorithmic thinking and coding have always clicked with me. However, I just felt a stronger instinct to study math, knowing it could push me out of my comfort zone more as a learner and student. </p>
		<p>Before entering college, I was precautioned that studying pure math would be vastly different from the number math I was used to; nonetheless, those expectations were met. As confusing as the Gram-Schmidt procedure or Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem could get, I still found passion in logically finding my way through a proof. I’ve intensely covered subjects such as linear algebra, topology, and real analysis, diving deep into their purely theoretical nature. However, I still missed that tangible solution that number math offered me, which invoked me to pursue statistics. The first statistics course I ever took, PSTAT 10, became the first course I was a learning assistant for the following year. Even though I felt lacking in my statistics ability, being a learning assistant boosted my confidence and allowed me the thought that I was just as capable. As I journeyed further in studying statistics and data science, I took on courses such as applied probability and statistical theory, linear regression, and machine learning. I’ve been fortunate enough that my math courses have led me to develop a better understanding and visualization of data transformation and model evaluation to supplement my pursuit of data science. </p>
		<p>I love how the logic of math applies to both statistics and computer science. Data science offers me the best of both worlds and I’ve had an amazing experience being able to align my interests.</p>
