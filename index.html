								<p>Hi! I'm an undergraduate at UC Santa Barbara, pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science. Originally from the East Bay Area, I currently reside in the South San Jose area. I created this website to showcase and give more insight into my work. I have an interest in the data analytics and tech industry, with experience using R, SQL, C++, and HTML.</p>

								<p>With over 7 years experience of tutoring elementary, middle, high school, and college students, both in-person and online, I'm also working towards a minor in education with a focus on the secondary track of science and mathematics. I currently serve as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, in which I hold biweekly office hours, lead lab sections, and facilitate lectures to answer student questions. As I strive to facilitate my students’ learning, my greatest priority as a tutor is to build rapport: I believe that a student is best able to learn in an environment where they feel comfortable enough to ask questions and make mistakes. My consistent efforts in building this rapport have successfully aided me in transforming the tutor-tutee relationship into friendships, ultimately encouraging students to attend office hours more regularly and become more proactive with their education.</p>
									
								<p>Aside from academia, I'm extremely passionate about advocating, discussing, and caring for mental health. I've had the opportunity to involve myself with Lean On Me, an anonymous peer-to-peer texting service specializing in providing emotional support for college students across different campuses. As a supporter of the UCSB chapter, I've practiced effective communication skills such as attentive listening, awareness, and reflection to best provide emotional support for my peers. As a dedicated supporter, I am also committed to my position on the executive board, having served as the Finance Coordinator in the 2022-23 academic year and the current Social Media Coordinator. Other responsibilities I execute on the board include leading biweekly club meetings, interviewing and training incoming supporters, and having presented at UCSB’s 2023 Mental Health Conference.</p>
								
								<p>It would be a privilege to bridge my interests and skills in the field of data science with my passion for making an impact on my community. 
									I am invested in finding solutions and playing a role in creating a better world.
