	<h2 class="major">About</h2>
		<span class="image"><img src="images/intropic.png"  width = "300" class = "center" alt="" /></span>

		<p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I'm a 3rd year undergraduate at UC Santa Barbara, pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science. Originally from the East Bay Area, I currently reside in the Silicon Valley. 
			Aside my professional interest in the data science industry, with an emphasis on data analytics, I am passionate about helping others and making a difference in my community,
			which motivates me in other pursuits such as education and mental health awareness.
		</p>
		<p>It would be a privilege to bridge my interests and skills in the data analytics field with my passion for making an impact on the community. 
			I am invested in finding solutions and playing a role in creating a better world.
		</p>

		<h4>Data Analytics</h4>
		<div class="badge-base LI-profile-badge" data-locale="en_US" data-size="large" data-theme="light" data-type="VERTICAL" data-vanity="anthonycu" data-version="v1"><a class="badge-base__link LI-simple-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonycu?trk=profile-badge"></a></div>      
		<!--	<p>With experience in data visualization using ggplot2 and big data with data manipulation tools such as SQL and dplyr to extract, clean, condense, and merge data, I am seeking a data analysis internship to utilize my skills for the success of the organization.-->

		<h4>Education</h4>
		<p>With over 7 years experience of tutoring elementary, middle, high school, and college students, both in-person and online, I'm also working towards a minor in education with a focus on the secondary track of science and mathematics. 
		<br>I currently serve as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, in which I hold biweekly office hours, lead lab sections, and facilitate lectures alongside the professor to answer student questions. 
		<br>As I strive to facilitate my students’ learning, my greatest priority as a tutor is to build rapport: I believe that a student is best able to learn in an environment where they feel comfortable enough to ask questions and make mistakes. 
			My consistent efforts in building this rapport have successfully aided me in transforming the tutor-tutee relationship into friendships, ultimately encouraging students to attend office hours more regularly and become more proactive with their education.</p>
		
		<h4>Mental Health</h4>
		<span>Aside from academia, I'm extremely passionate about advocating, discussing, and caring for mental health. I've had the opportunity to involve myself with Lean On Me, an anonymous peer-to-peer texting service specialized
			in providing emotional support for college students across different campuses. 
			<br>As a supporter and executive board member for the UCSB chapter, I've practiced effective communication skills such as attentive listening, awareness, and reflection 
			to best support my peers. Some accomplishments I’ve achieved on the board include:</span>
		<ul>
			<li>as the Finance Coordinator (2022-23): networked and presented to relevant organizations, successfully raising $2000+ of funding; maintained annual budget plan, managing national fees and chapter-specific payments</li>
			<li>as the Social Media Coordinator (2023-24): created advertisement and information designs, that discuss and spread awareness on mental health related topics </li>
			<li>presented at UCSB’s 2023 Mental Health Conference </li>
			<li>lead biweekly club meetings, interview and train incoming supporters</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Diseases Of Affluence</h3> 
		<p>In summer 2023, I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Uma Ravat and Gurmeet Manku on Manku's project studying what is known to be "Diseases of Affluence" in India.
			His research examined the correlation between people's wealth and their diet, which their diet ultimately impacts diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension.
			<br> <br>Below are selected visulations I created for the research project:

		<h3>Lean On Me</h3> 
		<p>Through my involvement with Lean On Me UCSB, I had the opportunity to work in the data analytics team as a Data Visualization Intern for Lean On Me National in summer 2022. 
			By analyzing over 6 years of existing temporal, binary, qualitative and quantitative data, 
			I created visualizations using the ggplot2 and Plotly libraries under R, in order to display on the organization’s national as well as individual chapter websites. 
			With this data, I drew conclusions and relationships through visualizing bar graphs, time series charts, and box-and-whisker plots to effectively communicate the texting services’ impact in its communities.

<!--			<p>Before entering college, I was precautioned that studying pure math would be vastly different from the number math I was used to in high school;
					 nonetheless, those expectations were met. As confusing as the Gram-Schmidt procedure or Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem could get, 
					 I still found passion in logically finding my way through a proof. 
					 I’ve intensely covered subjects such as linear algebra, topology, and real analysis, 
					 diving deep into their purely theoretical nature. 
					 However, I still missed that tangible solution that number math offered me, which invoked me to pursue statistics. 
				</p> 
				<p>The first statistics course I ever took, PSTAT 10, became the first course I was a learning assistant for, in my second year of college. 
					 Even though I felt lacking in my statistics ability, being a learning assistant boosted my confidence and allowed me 
					 the thought that I was just as capable. As I journeyed further in studying statistics and data science, 
					 I took on courses such as applied probability and statistical theory, linear regression, and machine learning. 
					 I’ve been fortunate enough that my math courses have led me to develop a better understanding and visualization of data transformation and model evaluation 
					 to supplement my pursuit of data analytics and science.
